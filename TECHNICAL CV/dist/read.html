      <h3>This is more information about the projects I have worked on.</h3>
      <h5>Household data management system</h5>
      <p>With the library management system, it was a project we did in my second year to demostrate that we have acquired the necessary skills about software development.
        <br>
        This software collects and stores data about the number of people in a Household. It stores their skills and qualifications, etc.
        <br>
         Its main purpose is to assist community members with beneficial information about opportunities available for families to make their lives better. For example, opportunities like jobs, learnerships, etc.
      </p>

    <div class="base-container">
      <h5>library management system</h5>
      <p>This software basically recorded the credentials of the person who borrowed a book from our local libary.
        <br>
        It recorded how many books were borrowed, and how long the person is supposed to use the book before they can return it to the library
        <br>
        The software was coded and developed using C# programming language.

    <div class="base-container">
      <h5>Text messages app</h5>
      <p>On the text messages app, we designed this app similar to WhatsApp which sent text messages, videos, music, files, etc.
        <br>
        This app was to test whether we have obtained and mastered the relevant technologies needed for cloud computing with databases. This software has to function in real as how a normal text messages app should function.
